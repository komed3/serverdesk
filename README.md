# ServerDesk

Virtual server monitoring application that runs without a GUI using an IPS panel with a touch interface.

This program will run automatically as soon as the server starts and operates in the background as a service for displaying and managing various things, such as `htop`, `dmesg`, `iftop`, `bash`, `update` and much more.
